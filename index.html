                    <p align="justify">Amal Jyothi College of Engineering  Model United Nations is a one-day intra college  simulation for college school students held  in Amal Jyothi. At AJCEMUN, delegates gain insight into the workings of the United Nations and the dynamics of international relations by assuming the roles of UN representatives and members of other international bodies and national cabinets. AJCEMUN is an exciting opportunity for students to debate issues that confront world leaders and to draft resolutions in response to these global issues. Participants will develop their abilities to work with others who are equally motivated and passionate about the topics of debate and to respond to global concerns.</p>
<p align="justify">True to the spirit of the United Nations AJCEMUN strives to foster a constructive forum for open dialogue on complex global issues, including international peace and security and economic and social progress. AJCEMUN stresses the in-depth examination and resolution of pressing issues, emphasizing process over product. During the conference, students learn the importance of balancing national interests with the needs of the international community, while also learning about the powers and limitations of international negotiation. Delegates will preserve their countries’ national policy while negotiating in the face of other, sometimes conflicting, international policies.

                  <h3 class="section-title multiple-title">What is MUN?</h3>
                  <p>Model United Nations is an academic simulation of the United Nations where students play the role of delegates from different countries and attempt to solve real world issues with the policies and perspectives of their assigned country. For example, a student may be assigned the United Kingdom and will have to solve global topics such as nuclear non-proliferation or climate change from the policies and perspectives of the United Kingdom. Students can attend Model United Nations conferences around the world. These conferences are organized by universities, high schools, non-profit organizations, and other educational groups. Conferences are offered for different academic levels: college and university, high school, middle school, and grade school. There is no central governing body for Model UN — any school can create a Model UN team and register for any Model UN conference they wish to attend.</p>

												<p><i><strong>“We do not need magic to change the world, we carry all the power we need inside ourselves already;we have the power to imagine better”</strong><br>
													-J.K Rowling</i></p>

												<p>It is an honor for me to serve as the Secretary General of the AJCE Model United Nations. As such, it gives me greater satisfaction to welcome all of you to the conference.</p>

												<p>The main objective behind the initiation of the AJCEMUN is to provide a platform for students to be part of an experience that not many students are always fortunate to be a part of.</p>
												<p>AJCEMUN 2018 is an ambitious project developed by young, creative and ingenious students from Amal Jyothi Collage .Thus, the aim of such a conference is promoting the Model United Nations’ message and principles, as well as bringing the students closer to knowing what’s happening in the world at the moment, through coming up and debating upon solutions that would maintain international peace and defend equality among individuals</p>

												<p>Our organizing team is working very hard to create an incredible experience for all of you and we cannot wait to show you what AJCEMUN has in store, as we hope it will exceed all your expectations. We couldn’t be more excited to host you in March and we look forward to meeting each one of you at  AJCEMUN 2018!</p>

												<p>Yours truly,
												<br>Noel Mathew Varghese Vaidyan </p>
